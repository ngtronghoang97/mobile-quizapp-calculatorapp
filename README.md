# mobile-quizapp-calculatorapp

This is the simple calculator application and the quiz application.

As for the simple calculator, I just coded for two values that can be added and subtracted. To develop this app, you can code for multiple and divide. Furthermore, developers also improve this code to make it more convenient because this is a bonus task for me.

In terms of the quiz app, user can click the radio button to answer the question, and the app will display the correct or incorrect answer according to the user's answer. Finally, the application will display the number of correct answers relative to the total number of questions.

Thank you for reading and practising.
